> Katsuyou is a small application to learn and practice conjugations for Japaneese verbs and phrases.

#### How to Develop

To get all the dependencies installed, and start the local development server just run the following:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

From here, you can start the iOS simulator by hitting `i` (assuming that you have it installed via xcode).

#### Supported Conjugations

There can be different tenses of the conjugations:

- past
- past polite
- present polite
- passive
- potential
- causative
- te-form

We should also quiz for possibly negative forms of each tense. For example:
`たべる → 食べなかった`
`食べられない　→ 食べられなかった`

#### Issues

Please add any outstanding bugs, or features to the Github issues page.
